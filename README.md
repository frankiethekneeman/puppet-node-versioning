Please maintain sensible spacing between logical blocks of code, and a 4 space indent - no tabs,
thank you.  Where line breaks are concerned - readability is the key here.  Since we're no longer
using [punch cards](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/148677/why-is-80-characters-the-standard-limit-for-code-width)
to run our code, there's no need for our lines to fit into a specific line length 100% of the time.
That being said, this repository likes to wrap between 80 and 100 characters when possible, to
facilitate a broad range of coding display styles.  If you use 
[puppet-lint](http://puppet-lint.com/), I suggest you also use the flag to disable the 
[80 character line limit](http://puppet-lint.com/checks/80chars/).
